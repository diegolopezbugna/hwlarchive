# hwlarchive
Import bmp files into a hwl container

Usage:
Copy .exe and zlibwapi.dll to DATA folder.
Create 'bmps' folder with the bmps (24 or 32 bits) that will be updated in the d3dbitmaps.hwl file.
Beware that contents will be appended, so if you make the update several times the file will be larger every time.

Requirement:
https://zlib.net/
